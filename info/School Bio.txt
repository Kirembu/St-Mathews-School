children of Cowalenga community offered children services such as payment of school fees, training the
community on child rights, home based care, drug abuse and peer education among others. in the year
2007, the Government of Kenya announced free primary and Secondary Education and which free
education was never to be because the government schools could not accommodate all the children in
their institutions and this saw a massive dropout of the secondary going children that depended on Plan
following its withdrawal to fund in order to support the government initiative. When Peter and Esther

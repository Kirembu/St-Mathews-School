Amos is in form three at St. Mathews. He lives with his one parent who is a watchman earning 8,000KSH. He has 5 siblings, one at University, teo in secondary school and two in Primary. All of them depend on their father who is the only breadwinner. Amos stayed for one year after finishing his primary education without going to school due to his lack of school fees. He, however, did not lose hope and here he is a very bright student. Nyangoto needs great financial assistance.

Jane Wanijiku is in form three at St. Mathews Sesinia School. She joined us this year after she was chased from her fathers home by her father who claimed that she was not his biological daughter. She used to live with both her parents in Thika but was forced to drop out of school at form four at the time of registration for her nathional examination to go and stay with her grandparents who don't have any employment. Our school came to her rescue after learning about her case from her cousin is in form one at our school. Jane really needs urgent assistance.

Brian is 13 and in form one at St. Mathews Sesinia School. He joined our school during second term after staying out of school for a full term due to lack of school fees. His mother is an only parent. St. Mathews Sesinia School came to seek to help Brian, and since joining has shown great interest and determination to excel in life. He has three siblings but the mother depends on well wishes for their food. He really needs financial assistance.
